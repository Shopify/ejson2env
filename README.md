# ejson2env

`ejson2env` is a tool to simplify storing secrets that should be accessible in the shell environment in your git repo. `ejson2env` is based on the [ejson library](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson) and extends the `ejson` file format.

`ejson2env` exports all of the values in the `environment` object in the `ejson` file to the shell environment.

For example, with the below `ejson` file:

```json
{
    "_public_key": "<public key here>",
    "environment": {
        "SECRET_SHELL_VARIABLE": "<encrypted data>"
    }
}
```

Running:

```shell
$ ejson2env test.ejson
```

Would result in the following output:

```
export SECRET_SHELL_VARIABLE=<decrypted data>
```

You can then have your shell evaluate this output:

```shell
$ eval $(ejson2env test.ejson)
```
